I am a skilled Java Developer with a track record of success that started during my college days when I initiated a personal project to rebuild my college's main website. This project led me to secure an internship at Grupo Memorial where I gained experience in Angular, Node, Java, JPA, JSF, and Primefaces, building APIs, integrations, and enhancements for the company's ERP system. I also played a key role in implementing the Scrum framework, integrating forms with Trello for card creation.

As a Junior Developer at Blogudev, I furthered my expertise in Angular and Node, and gained my first exposure to cloud development using AWS, utilizing tools such as Amplify, API Gateway, and more. I also performed unit testing on API requests to ensure their functionality and reliability, and implemented i18n for multi-language support on the frontend.

At IBM, I was hired as a Java Developer but also worked with Angular on various scopes and tasks. I worked on projects for Santander, where I was responsible for the No Contact project, as well as integrations with marketing platforms and improvements to Santander's messaging and marketing operations systems. I also built microservices with Spring Boot, integrated with SSO authentication services, implemented route permissions, and more.

Recently, I joined Dell to work on an internal project, where my focus is entirely on Java with Spring Boot. I am involved in the construction and documentation of microservices, leveraging my expertise in Java development to contribute to the project's success.
